# gman

***G***ive ***M***e ***A*** ***N***ame.

Sometimes you just cannot figure out what on Earth to name something, I know that I am constantly stuck in
an endless loop of staring off and forgetting what I was working on before I had to think of what to call my rubbish.
That is why *gman* exists! Git branches, project names, children! Name them all with gman!

Currently at version `1.1.0`, meaning it is working at a basic level but more features are to be added.


# current features

 - prefixes
 - suffixes
 - word counts
 - 8 casing formats

# to be made

 - bash wrapper
 - data sources
 - windows support
 - ui support
