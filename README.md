# gman

***G***ive ***M***e ***A*** ***N***ame.

Need a name for something? Git branches, project names, or children... just use *gman* to name it!

Currently at version `1.1.0`, it currently has most of the features I intend, but they aren't fully fleshed out yet.


# install

I created an small installation script so I won't need to do this manually again at some point. 

`$ sudo ./src/main/scripts/install.sh`

It's as easy as that!


# current features

 - prefixes
 - suffixes
 - word counts
 - 8 casing formats


# to be made

 - logs
 - data sources
 - windows support
 - ui support
